To do that you can check out [BFG Repo Cleaner](!https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/) or you use `git filter-branch`. Check out this (guide)[!https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/removing-sensitive-data-from-a-repository#using-filter-branchs] on how to use it.\n\nHave fun!"},{"id":1595099460,"title":"Test post","author":"No author given","date":"July 18, 2020","time":"20:11","content":"![Test image](placeholder-6-.png \"Gravity Headers\")\n\n## Background\n\nThere are a couple of issues that users face while integrating or working with Netlify CMS and while the community is doing their best fixing them, here is a list of known issues and their solutions.\n\n## API Errors\n\nA list of error messages and their possible cause(s) to provide more context while debugging.\n\n#### 1.

Error Message\n\n```\nAPI_ERROR: Not Found\n```\n\n#### Possible Cause\n\n* The org account needs to grant access to your Netlify CMS instance.

The upside of this method is that it’s fast and easy, no other configuration needed. The downside is that all of your users are downloading the widget while they might not need it. That’s kb’s wasted. Unless you’re using Netlify Identity for something else than the authentication of CMS users, utilize the next solution.\n* Change the invitation emails! This takes a bit more time, but it’s probably the cleanest solution. You already have the identity widget loaded at your `admin/` page, so you might as well have your users confirm their email there.
